Choosing the best laptop for podcasting in 2022: updated review

Basic Podcast Recording Equipment
In addition to giving you a good idea of ​​what equipment you'll need for your own podcast studio, we've included links to individual posts to help you find the right products for your unique recording needs.

A computer
The first and most obvious piece of podcasting equipment you will need is a computer. After all, this is where all the magic happens, from capturing and editing audio to exporting and publishing. Recording a podcast is usually not as demanding as professional music production, so you can make do with what you already have. But if you're looking to upgrade your computer, you can check out some of the best laptops for audio production.

Microphones
One of the main reasons why it's important to determine exactly what equipment you'll need for podcasting is that you can't just use any microphone - especially the built-in microphone on your computer, camera, or phone. These mics are more likely to pick up ambient and background noise and sound less professional.

To record high quality audio, you will need a separate analog or USB microphone. Most beginner podcasters choose USB microphones because they allow you to simply plug the microphone directly into your computer and start recording. But if you want more flexibility and have multiple people joining your show, you will need XLR mics. Again, the number of microphones you need also depends on the podcast format you choose.

Check out our recommendations for choosing USB/XLR condenser and dynamic microphones in our list of the best podcasting microphones.

## pop filter
Another important piece of equipment that will help you record great-sounding vocals is a pop filter or windscreen. Its main purpose is to minimize or prevent "splash" like your "P" and "T" by absorbing these powerful air currents before the sound reaches your microphone.

If you have a Blue Yeti microphone, the aforementioned Blue "The Pop" filter will work great with it. You can check out our list of the best pop filters to find the one that works for your microphone.

## Microphone stands
To mount the mic and pop filter together, you'll need a sturdy mic stand. But that's not the only use of a mic stand; it will also help you position the microphone correctly so you don't have to lean forward or down to speak into the microphone.

If you're not too picky about your choice of mic stand or are on a budget, you'll find plenty of affordable desktop mic stands like the K&M 23325 (). But if you need more flexibility, others prefer to invest in foldable table poles like the Rode PSA1 () to free up desk space and be able to quickly position and move the mic without twisting any knobs. Some condenser microphones come with their own stand, designed for ease of use and flexibility.

## Impact mount
Every time you move or reposition a microphone, slap your hand on a table after a particularly impassioned recitation, or type on a keyboard, these movements cause vibrations and are transmitted into the recording as short, sharp sounds. Remember - microphones are very sensitive to surface vibrations, so another thing you'll need in the studio is a shock mount to absorb these vibrations and prevent them from reaching your microphone.

When you buy a microphone, ask for a compatible shock mount from the same brand. It is important that the mount's resiliency matches the weight of the microphone, so it is better to choose a specialized mount, such as the Rode PSM1 () for a Rode Podcaster or Procaster microphone, than a cheaper "universal" mount designed by third parties.

## Headphones
The headphones serve as an audio monitor, so it's common to see podcasters (and even recording artists) wearing headphones while recording. It may be strange to hear your own voice at first, but this is the best way to control the sound quality and check for noise overlap and microphone level unevenness so you don't have to reshoot.

While some podcasters use headphones effectively, for a truly professional podcast studio, you'll need closed-back headphones (such as Audio Technica) so that the sound coming from the headphones doesn't spill over into the microphone. Luckily, there are plenty of high-quality podcasting microphones available at almost any price point.
