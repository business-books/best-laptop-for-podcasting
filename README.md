Choosing the best laptop for podcasting in 2022: updated review

## Basic Podcast Recording Equipment
In addition to giving you a good idea of what equipment you'll need for your own podcast studio, we've included links to individual posts to help you find the right products for your unique recording needs.

## Laptop for podcasting
The first and most obvious piece of podcasting equipment you will need is a computer. After all, this is where all the magic happens, from capturing and editing audio to exporting and publishing. Recording a podcast is usually not as demanding as professional music production, so you can make do with what you already have. But if you're looking to upgrade your computer, you can check out this review to pick the [best laptop for podcasting](https://qualified.one/blog/content_marketing/best-laptop-for-podcasting/).

## Microphones
One of the main reasons why it's important to determine exactly what equipment you'll need for podcasting is that you can't just use any microphone - especially the built-in microphone on your computer, camera, or phone. These mics are more likely to pick up ambient and background noise and sound less professional.

To record high quality audio, you will need a separate analog or USB microphone. Most beginner podcasters choose USB microphones because they allow you to simply plug the microphone directly into your computer and start recording. But if you want more flexibility and have multiple people joining your show, you will need XLR mics. Again, the number of microphones you need also depends on the podcast format you choose.

Check out our recommendations for choosing USB/XLR condenser and dynamic microphones in our list of the best podcasting microphones.

## Pop filter
Another important piece of equipment that will help you record great-sounding vocals is a pop filter or windscreen. Its main purpose is to minimize or prevent "splash" like your "P" and "T" by absorbing these powerful air currents before the sound reaches your microphone.

If you have a Blue Yeti microphone, the aforementioned Blue "The Pop" filter will work great with it. You can check out our list of the best pop filters to find the one that works for your microphone.

## Microphone stands
To mount the mic and pop filter together, you'll need a sturdy mic stand. But that's not the only use of a mic stand; it will also help you position the microphone correctly so you don't have to lean forward or down to speak into the microphone.

If you're not too picky about your choice of mic stand or are on a budget, you'll find plenty of affordable desktop mic stands like the K&M 23325 (). But if you need more flexibility, others prefer to invest in foldable table poles like the Rode PSA1 () to free up desk space and be able to quickly position and move the mic without twisting any knobs. Some condenser microphones come with their own stand, designed for ease of use and flexibility.

## Impact mount
Every time you move or reposition a microphone, slap your hand on a table after a particularly impassioned recitation, or type on a keyboard, these movements cause vibrations and are transmitted into the recording as short, sharp sounds. Remember - microphones are very sensitive to surface vibrations, so another thing you'll need in the studio is a shock mount to absorb these vibrations and prevent them from reaching your microphone.

When you buy a microphone, ask for a compatible shock mount from the same brand. It is important that the mount's resiliency matches the weight of the microphone, so it is better to choose a specialized mount, such as the Rode PSM1 () for a Rode Podcaster or Procaster microphone, than a cheaper "universal" mount designed by third parties.

## Headphones
The headphones serve as an audio monitor, so it's common to see podcasters (and even recording artists) wearing headphones while recording. It may be strange to hear your own voice at first, but this is the best way to control the sound quality and check for noise overlap and microphone level unevenness so you don't have to reshoot.

While some podcasters use headphones effectively, for a truly professional podcast studio, you'll need closed-back headphones (such as Audio Technica) so that the sound coming from the headphones doesn't spill over into the microphone. Luckily, there are plenty of high-quality podcasting microphones available at almost any price point.

Headphone Amplifier
Every performer at your show will need a headphone monitor, so you'll need a multi-channel headphone amplifier that can drive more than one headphone jack and maximize the sound quality potential of each of your headphones.

We recommend that you choose an amplifier that has at least four channels, such as the Behringer HA400 ().

Audio interface
You usually hear (and see) an audio interface in recording studios. When setting up a podcast studio, you will most likely need the same essential equipment, albeit much smaller and more affordable. The audio interface basically serves as a bridge that converts microphone audio signals to digital so you can "send" them to your computer for playback, mixing, and download.

As mentioned earlier, some USB microphones can be connected directly to a computer or laptop. However, some podcasters prefer to use the magic of an audio interface to preserve the quality of the original audio, rather than relying on a computer's sound card for critical audio transformation.

Audio interfaces often allow multiple input and output channels, so you can record from multiple microphones and even instruments. Most of them also have preamps to amplify the microphone signal (using built-in preamps) to eliminate delays, noise, and timing distortion (or jitter). Focusrite is one of the most common names in the interface market, but you can choose from our list of the best audio interfaces for audio recording.

mixer
Like an audio interface, a mixer helps improve your sound quality by giving you more control over audio levels, inputs, outputs, and more. Most digital audio workstations (DAWs) allow you to mix and master multiple audio channels on your computer, but while some podcasters prefer to do it manually, sometimes there's no choice, especially if you're going to invite remote guests (call-in).

Cables
If you're going to use an audio interface, mixer, preamp, or all of the above, you'll definitely need the right microphone and instrument cables.

Instead of just buying any suitable cable, look for a quality XLR microphone cable to greatly reduce your audio interference. We recommend you start with a mid-priced cable like the Rapco Horizon N1M1-15 () or choose one of the specialized podcasting cables we offer on Adorama.

Digital audio recorder
Depending on the podcast format you choose, there may be times when you need to interview outside of the studio. In this case, we highly recommend that you use a reliable portable digital voice recorder (preferably with an external microphone) to record and save audio to a microSD card.

You can choose the cheapest from our list of the best digital audio recorders for podcasting and still be able to record better sound with it than with a smartphone and an external microphone. Many smartphones, such as some iPhone models, no longer have a microphone or headphone jack, so using a dedicated digital voice recorder is a good idea. Pay attention to the type of audio input you require so that you have any adapters you may need. Some digital voice recorders are also used as audio interfaces, which can be directly connected to a computer via the built-in USB port, so you can save up for a more powerful interface.

## Data storage devices
Audio producers in general are encouraged to export heavy audio files they don't need immediately (such as old, raw material) to external hard drives so that the computer's internal memory can focus on faster work during import, audio editing, and export. But for podcasting, you can start with small external portable hard drives and upgrade them later. USB sticks are also useful to have with you if you need to bring, share or present your content in person.

## Soundproof materials
As in any other recording studio, you will need acoustic treatment of the room. The extent of this depends on how much echo or reverb is present, as well as the amount of external noise coming from outside, if any.

At a minimum, you will need to install acoustic panels on the walls (and possibly the ceiling). Learn more about room soundproofing to understand what you need to do to turn your room into a soundproof recording studio.

## Podcast recording software
Podcast recording software will give you much more flexibility and control over your content than Zoom, Google Meet or other video conferencing software. While programs like Zoom offer limited audio output and level control options, podcast recording software is designed to deliver the highest quality audio possible. For the most professional results, consider tools like Audacity, Squadcast, ProTools, or Adobe Audition.

Recording programs vary in price and functionality. Some programs are available in both Apple and PC versions, while others are specifically designed for one OS or the other. Some recording software includes post-production capabilities, while others are purely for recording and organizing audio files. It's a good idea to check out all the options in your price range to see what features you need the most and what will work with your computer.

Enough about the room and equipment. Once you've decided on the external hardware, don't forget to decide on the recording software you'll be using on your computer. Your choice depends on your computer's operating system, but you can find many free, cross-platform programs (such as Adobe Audition) that can be used on both PC and Mac.

Before you start recording, take the time to familiarize yourself with some of the best podcast recording software and their features to see which one best suits your audio editing needs and skill level.

## Hosting for podcasts
The final important step in the podcasting workflow is getting your podcast to iTunes or other hosts (after you've recorded and edited it). This is where you will hopefully start getting heard and gaining popularity, especially if you plan on making money from your podcasts.

Besides iTunes and SoundCloud, there are many other popular podcast platforms. While it helps to get your shows on the platforms with the largest audiences, you need to choose the right one for your show in order to successfully reach your desired demographic - so choose wisely!

If you don't feel like building your own studio from scratch, you can always purchase podcasting kits (starting at ) that include carefully selected equipment from certain brands.
